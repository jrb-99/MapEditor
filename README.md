🗺️ WELCOME TO MY MAP EDITOR!

At the 5th week of my 14-week intensive programming bootcamp at Code For All_, Code Cadets were challanged to create a map editor, where the user should able to 
navigate through the grid controlling his cursor, and should also be able to paint and delete positions in the grid as he wanted!

This project was developed individually, is written in Java and the GUI is provided by a library created by Code For All_, called "simple-graphics" 
(Check it out here: https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics)

Controls:

- WASD: Navigate the cursor
- SPACEBAR: Paint positions
- E: Delete positions

### 🚧 Work in Progress 🚧 ### 

- I used a Map collection to store the painted positions, but I believe it may be causing some problems, a 2D-Array should be better suited ✅
- I should refactor the structure of my program in order to have a better organized and preformant code. A "cell" context should be added ✅
- A feature to save (write) the painted positions to a file and load (read) them from the file using I/O byte streams should be added ⏳

Feel free to explore my Map Editor. Contributions and suggestions are warmly welcomed! 🚀🌈
